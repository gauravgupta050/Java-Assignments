Q1 :  Array is an object which contains elements of a similar data type. Additionally, The elements of an array are stored in a contiguous memory location. It is a data structure where we store similar elements. We can store only a fixed set of elements in a Java array.

Q2: To create an array in a single statement, you first declare the type of the array, followed by the name of the array, and then the values of the array enclosed in curly braces, separated by commas.
     Example: int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

Q3: No, we cant change the array size at run time.

Q4: Yes. We can declare an array without size but before using it needs to be initialized.

Q5: The default value of array is zero.

Q6: A one-dimensional array in Java is a collection of similar types of elements stored at contiguous memory locations. The data is stored in a continuous manner, which makes operations like search, delete, insert etc., much easier.

Q7: int[][] oddNumbers = { {1, 3, 5, 7}, {9, 11, 13, 15}, {17, 19, 21, 23} };

    for(int i = 0; i < oddNumbers.length; i++){
        for(int j = 0; j < oddNumbers[i].length; j++){
            System.out.println(oddNumbers[i][j]);
        }   
    }
